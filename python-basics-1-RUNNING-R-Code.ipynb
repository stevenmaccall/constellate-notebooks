        "[Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) is the fastest-growing language in computer programming. Learning [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) is a great choice because [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) is:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Widely-adopted in the digital humanities and data science\n",
        "* Regarded as an easy-to-learn language\n",
        "* Flexible, having wide support for working with numerical and textual data\n",
        "* A skill desired by employers in academic, non-profit, and private sectors\n",
        "\n",
        "The second most-popular language for digital humanities and data science work is [R](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#r). We plan to create additional support for learning [R](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#r) soon. If you are interested in helping develop open educational resources for [R](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#r), please reach out to Nathan Kelber (nathan.kelber@ithaka.org).\n",
        "\n",
        "The skills you'll learn in *Python Basics* 1-5 are general-purpose [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) skills, applicable for any of the text analysis notebooks that you may explore later. They are also widely applicable to many other kinds of tasks in [Python](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#python) beyond text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Making Mistakes is Important**\n",
        "\n",
        "Every programmer at every skill level gets errors in their code. Making mistakes is how we all learn to program. Programming is a little like solving a puzzle where the goal is to get the desired outcome through a series of attempts. You won't solve the puzzle if you're afraid to test if the pieces match. An error message will not break your computer. Remember, you can always reload a notebook if it stops working properly or you misplace an important piece of code. Under the edit menu, there is an option to undo changes. (Alternatively, you can use **command z** on Mac and **control z** on Windows.) To learn any skill, you need to be willing to play and experiment. Programming is no different.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Expressions and Operators\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest form of Python programming is an [expression](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#expression) using an [operator](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#operator). An [expression](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#expression) is a simple mathematical statement like:\n",

        "\n",
        "The [operator](https://constellate.org/docs/key-terms/#operator) in this case is `+`, sometimes called \"plus\" or \"addition\". Try this operation in the code box below. Remember to click the \"Run\" button or press Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or shift + return (OS X) on your keyboard to run the code."

There are also style *guidelines* that, while they won't break your code, are generally advised for making your code readable and understandable.
